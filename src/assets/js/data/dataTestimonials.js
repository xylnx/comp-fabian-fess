    quoteLong: '" I have worked closely with Fabian on promotional videos for our Digital Humanities Hackthon in Helsinki and other projects. What I find striking about Fabian is his ability to manage and coordinate the projects. After our first brainstorming he created a very detailed storyboard and Interview questions.  Throughout the process he paid attention to my wishes and ideas and contributed his cinematic expertise to the discussions. During the shooting I found it particularly amazing how he coordinated all the different situations, people and interviews and was always professional and friendly. I would certainly work with Fabian again and I recommend him as a true professional who is delightful to work with."',

I immediately thought that Fabian would be the ideal person to film these events for us. Fabian is true pleasure to work with. Not only is he friendly and kind, he is extremely professional, well-organised and hard working, delivering beautiful documentaries in a timely manner. I would not hesitate for a moment in recommending Fabian’s work. "',
