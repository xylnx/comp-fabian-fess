        <p>Hi, my name is Fabian. I am a freelance filmmaker based in Berlin and Hannover.</p>
        
        <p>The focus of my work is audio-visual research communication. I produce documentaries, event films, corporate videos and other interactive multimedia video formats for national and international clients. They range from universities and research organizations to museums, libraries and private companies. I help my clients to communicate their message and reach out to a broader audience.</p>

        <p>I am my client’s partner throughout the whole film making process, starting from the initial idea up to the publication strategy of the final film. At first, I am always looking forward to developing an exciting and informative storyboard in close cooperation with my client.  My goal is to then realize these ideas in a cinematically ambitious manner and to create an inspiring, interesting and informative film in the post-production. In all my work, I am inspired by documentary narrative and film styles.</p>

        <p>My academic background is in visual anthropology. I also studied sociology, political sciences, and gender studies. I worked as a communication trainer and in the public relations department of the Göttingen State and University Library. My last feature film „Colors of Citizen Engagement“ is a documentary which has been screened at various national and international film festivals.</p>
